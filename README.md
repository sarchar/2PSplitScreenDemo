The purpose of this demo is to show off a split-screen effect I've been brain-idling on for a while.

## Description

This is a Godot project that uses a shader effect to blend between two player
cameras when they are far apart, and merges cameras when they move close
together. The separating line also rotates with the angle between the players
to always give the players a sense of direction towards the other player.

This effect might be good for multiplayer hack 'n slash games, RPG/Adventure
games, or anything you come up with:)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Godot stable v3.3

### Installing

* Install Godot v3.3
* Clone this repo and import the project.  Run the main screen from within the editor.
